<h2>REMARKS ON SALADS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the many varieties of food daily consumed,
none are more important than a
salad, rightly compounded. And there is
nothing more exasperating than an inferior
one. The salad is the Prince of the Menu,
and although a dinner be perfect in every
other detail except the salad, the affair will
be voted a failure if that be poor. It is
therefore necessary for those contemplating
dinner-giving, to personally overlook the
preparation of the salad if they wish favorable
criticism.</p>

<p>To become a perfect salad-maker, do not
attempt too much at first; practise on plain
salads and plain dressings before you try
combination salads, fancy dressings, and elaborate
garnishings, and you will soon become
proficient in the art. Do not prepare plain
salads until the moment they are wanted at
table. Should they be mixed long before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
they are served, you will find the lettuce
flabby and the dressing watery and insipid.</p>

<p>The importance of using none but the
purest condiments must not be overlooked,
for a perfect salad cannot be made with inferior
ingredients. Garnishing or decorating
salads presents an opportunity for displaying
artistic taste and judgment. The
most deliciously blended salad will not be
appreciated unless it is attractive in appearance.
No exact rule can be laid down for
garnishing; much depends on the judgment
and good taste of the salad maker. Original
ideas are commendable. Wild flowers neatly
arranged with alternate tufts of green
are very pretty during warm weather. During
cold weather garnish with pretty designs
cut from beets, turnips, radishes, celery,
etc.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p><b>Borage for Salads.</b>&mdash;This is an excellent
ingredient in nearly all vegetable salads.
Cover a champagne-bottle with raw cotton
or heavy, coarse flannel; fasten it with
thread; set the bottle in a soup-plate, and
pour warm water over it. Soak a handful
of borage seeds in warm water for fifteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
minutes; drain, and work them into the
flannel around the bottle, as evenly as possible.
Place the bottle and soup-plate in a
warm, dark place until the seeds sprout;
then bring it to the light. Keep water in
the plate constantly. When the shoots are
a few inches long, trim them off, as wanted,
and add them to any salad with a plain
dressing.</p>

<p><b><a name="Plain_Salad_Dressing" id="Plain_Salad_Dressing"></a>Plain Salad Dressing</b> is admissible
with nearly all salads. It is composed of
oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt, and nothing
else. Many who do not care particularly
for oil, use equal quantities of oil and vinegar,
others one-third vinegar to two-thirds
oil; these proportions satisfy a large class,
but four parts of oil to one of vinegar are
about the right proportions, provided the
vinegar is of the best.</p>

<p>The plain dressing is made in two ways,
either mixed in a bowl and the salad added
to it, or as follows: Take a tablespoon and
put in it (holding it over the salad) one saltspoonful
of salt, one-fourth this quantity of
freshly ground pepper, and a tablespoonful
of oil; mix and add to the salad. Add three
more tablespoonfuls of oil; toss the salad
lightly for a few seconds; lastly, add a tablespoonful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of sharp vinegar; toss the salad
again, and serve.</p>

<p><b>Mayonnaise.</b>&mdash;When preparing a mayonnaise
in summer keep the bowl as cold as
possible. Beat up the yolks of two raw
eggs to a smooth consistency, add two saltspoonfuls
of salt and one of white pepper,
and a tablespoonful of oil. Beat up thoroughly,
and by degrees add half a pint of oil.
When it begins to thicken add a few drops
of vinegar. The total amount of vinegar to
be used is two tablespoonfuls, and the
proper time to stop adding oil, and to add
drops of vinegar, is when the dressing has a
glassy look instead of a velvet appearance.
After a few trials almost any one can make
a mayonnaise, as it is very simple.</p>

<p><b>Anchovy Salad.</b>&mdash;Wash, skin, and bone
eight salted anchovies; soak them in water
for an hour; drain and dry them. Cut two
hard-boiled eggs into slices. Arrange the
leaves of a head of lettuce neatly in a salad-bowl
and add the anchovies and the eggs.
Prepare a plain dressing in a soup-plate,
pour it over the salad and serve. The fish
may be minced, chopped, or cut into fillets.</p>

<p><b>Asparagus Salad.</b>&mdash;Remove the binding
round a bunch of asparagus, cut off an inch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the root end of each stalk, scrape off the
outside skin, wash them, tie them in bunches
containing six to eight each, and boil, if
possible, with the heads standing just out
of the water, as the rising steam will cook
them sufficiently. If covered with water
the heads are cooked before the root
ends. When tender, plunge them into
cold water, drain, arrange them on a side
dish, pour over them a plain dressing, and
serve.</p>

<p><b>Beans, Lima, Salad of.</b>&mdash;Boil one pint
of lima beans for forty minutes in water
slightly salted; drain; put them in a salad-bowl,
and add three hot, boiled potatoes cut
into slices. Mince a stalk of celery; sprinkle
it over the vegetables. Prepare a plain
dressing, pour it over the salad, and set the
bowl in the ice-box; when cold, serve. A
little cold, boiled tongue may be added if
liked.</p>

<p><b>Beef Salad.</b>&mdash;Cut into neat pieces, an
inch in length, half a pound of boiled fresh
beef. Take two heads of crisp lettuce, reject
the outside leaves, wipe the small leaves
separately, place them in a salad-bowl, add
the beef. Chop up a sweet Spanish pepper,
add a tablespoonful to the salad. Prepare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a plain dressing, pour it over the salad;
just before serving, mix gently.</p>

<p><b>Beet Leaves Salad.</b>&mdash;The seed-leaves of
the beet were preferred by the Greeks to
lettuce. They are served the same as lettuce.
If a little old, scald them in hot water
a moment. Swiss chard is the midrib of
the beet leaf. Remove the leaves, cut the
midribs into equal lengths, tie in small
bunches, boil thirty minutes. Arrange on
a side dish, pour over them a plain dressing
and serve either hot or cold.</p>

<p><b>Bloater, Yarmouth, Salad of.</b>&mdash;Take
two whole fish from the can. Remove skin
and bone, and cut them into pieces an inch
square. Cut up three stalks of celery into
inch pieces and each piece into strips; place
these in a salad-bowl and add the fish.
Chop up three salt anchovies with a dozen
capers into very small pieces; strew over
the salad; add a plain dressing and toss
lightly before serving.</p>

<p><b>Breakfast Salad.</b>&mdash;Scald two ripe tomatoes;
peel off the skin, and place them in ice-water;
when very cold, slice them. Peel and
slice very thin one small cucumber. Put
four leaves of lettuce into a salad-bowl, add
the tomatoes and cucumber. Cut up one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
spring onion; add it, and, if possible, add
four or five tarragon leaves. Now add a
plain dressing and serve.</p>

<p><b>Brussels-Sprouts Salad.</b>&mdash;Pick over
carefully a quart of sprouts, wash well, and
boil rapidly for twenty minutes (if boiled
slowly they lose their color). Drain, and
plunge them into cold water. Drain again,
and put them into a salad-bowl. Mince
one-fourth of a pound of boiled ham, arrange
it neatly and evenly around the
sprouts, and around this arrange a border
of potato salad. Add a plain dressing, a
teaspoonful of herbs, and serve.</p>

<p><b>Carrot Salad.</b>&mdash;The young spring carrots
are excellent when served as a salad. Take
six of them, wash, wipe them with a coarse
towel, boil them for ten minutes, drain and
cut into narrow strips. Arrange neatly in
the centre of a salad-bowl; cut up half a
pound of cold boiled mutton into neat
pieces; put it around the carrots. Mince a
stalk of celery with a few tarragon leaves;
strew over the dish; add a plain dressing
and serve.</p>

<p><b>Cauliflower Salad.</b>&mdash;Put into a basin of
cold water a head of cauliflower, head downward,
add half a teaspoonful of salt, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wineglass of vinegar. Let stand for half or
three-fourths of an hour, drain, and put
it into a saucepan to boil until tender. The
length of time for boiling depends upon the
size of the head. Remove the scum carefully
as it rises, or it will discolor the cauliflower.
When done separate the sprigs,
and arrange them around the bowl, heads
outward. Put into the centre of the dish a
head of cabbage-lettuce, cover it with red
mayonnaise (<i>see <a href="#Lobster_Salad">Lobster Salad</a></i>), and sprinkle
a few capers on top. Mask the cauliflower
with mayonnaise, garnish with beet diamonds,
and the effect is very pleasing.</p>

<p><b>Celeriac Salad.</b>&mdash;Celeriac, or turnip-rooted
celery, is an excellent vegetable for the
gouty and the rheumatic. When stewed
and served with cream sauce, it is at its
best. It may be used in salads either raw
or boiled. If used raw, cut it into very thin
slices; if cooked, cut it into inch pieces.
Mix with it endive, potato, and a little boiled
tongue, in equal proportions; serve with a
plain dressing.</p>

<p><b>Celery Salad.</b>&mdash;With the exception of lettuce,
celery is more generally used as a salad
in this country than any other plant.</p>

<p>Cut off the root end of three heads of celery;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
wipe each leaf-stalk carefully, and cut
them into inch pieces. Cut each piece into
strips, put them into a salad-bowl, add a
plain mayonnaise, and serve.</p>

<p><b>Cherry Salad.</b>&mdash;Remove the stones from
a quart of fine, black ox-heart cherries.
Place them into a compote, dust powdered
sugar over them, and add half a wineglassful
each of sherry and cura&ccedil;oa. Just before
serving mix lightly.</p>

<p><b>Chicory Salad.</b>&mdash;Thoroughly wash and
drain two heads of chicory; cut away the
green leaves and use them for garnishing,
or boil them as greens. Cut off the root-end
from the bleached leaves, and put the
latter into a salad-bowl that has been rubbed
with a clove of garlic. Add half a dozen
tarragon leaves, four to six tablespoonfuls
of oil, a saltspoonful of white pepper, and
two saltspoonfuls of salt. Mix thoroughly.
Now add a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar,
and you have a delightful salad.</p>

<p><b>Chicken Salad.</b>&mdash;The average cook book
contains a good deal of nonsense about
this salad. Nothing can be more simple
than to mix a little nicely cut cold boiled
chicken and celery together, with a tablespoonful
or two of mayonnaise. Put this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
mixture into a salad-bowl, arrange it neatly,
and over all add a mayonnaise. Garnish
with celery tops, hard-boiled eggs, strips of
beets, etc. Use a little more celery than
chicken. Or, tear a few leaves of lettuce,
put them in a salad-bowl, and add half a
cold, boiled, tender chicken that has been
cut into neat pieces; pour over it a mayonnaise;
garnish neatly, and serve.</p>

<p>For large parties, and when the chicken
is apt to become dry, from having been cut
up long before it is wanted, it is best to
keep it moist by adding a plain dressing.
Drain it before using. Put on a flat side-dish
a liberal bed of crisp lettuce. Add
the chicken, garnish neatly, and, just before
sending to table, pour over it a mayonnaise.</p>

<p>If in hot weather, arrange the salad on a
dish that will stand in a small tub or kid.
Fill this with ice, place the dish on top, pin
a napkin or towel around the tub to hide it
from view. Flowers, smilax, etc., may be
pinned on this, which produce a very pretty
effect.</p>

<p>In ancient times the fairest and youngest
lady at table was expected to prepare and
mix the salad with her fingers. "<i>Retourner
la salade les doigts</i>," is the French way of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
describing a lady to be still young and
beautiful.</p>

<p><b>Codfish (Salt) Salad.</b>&mdash;Take three pieces
of codfish two inches square; split them in
two, and soak them in water over night.
Change the water twice, next day drain and
wipe dry. Baste each piece with a little
butter, and broil (they make a very nice
breakfast dish, served with drawn butter).
When cool, tear them apart, and cover with
a plain salad dressing; let stand for two
hours. Half fill a salad-bowl with crisp
lettuce leaves; drain the fish and add it to
the lettuce; add mayonnaise; garnish with
lemon-peel rings, hard-boiled eggs, etc., and
serve.</p>

<p><b>Corn Salad, or Fetticus.</b>&mdash;Carefully
pick over two quarts of fetticus; reject all
damaged leaves; wash, and dry in a napkin.
Place in a salad-bowl; add a pint of minced
celery and two hard-boiled eggs, chopped
fine; finally add a plain dressing, toss, and
serve.</p>

<p><b>Crab Salad.</b>&mdash;Boil three dozen hard-shell
crabs for twenty-five minutes. Let them
cool, then remove the top shell and tail;
quarter the remainder, and pick out the
meat carefully with a nut-picker or kitchen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
fork. The large claws should not be forgotten,
for they contain a dainty morsel;
the fat that adheres to the top shell should
not be overlooked. Cut up an amount of
celery equal in bulk to the crab meat; mix
both together with a few spoonfuls of plain
salad dressing; then put it in a salad-bowl.
Mask it with a mayonnaise; garnish with
crab-claws, shrimps, and hard-boiled eggs,
alternated with tufts of green, such as parsley,
etc.</p>

<p><b>Cray-fish Salad.</b>&mdash;Cray-fish (or craw-fish)
resemble small lobsters; they are excellent
as a salad, and are extensively used in garnishing
fish salads. Boil two dozen cray-fish
for fifteen minutes in water slightly
salted; break the shells in two; pick out
the tail part of each; cut it in two lengthwise;
remove the black ligament. Put into
a salad-bowl the small white leaves of a
head of cabbage-lettuce; add the fish; pour
over them a mayonnaise. Garnish with the
head part of the shells, tufts of green, and
hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p><b>Cress Salad.</b>&mdash;Cress is one of our best
spring salads. Pick the leaves over carefully,
removing the bruised leaves and all
large stems. Mince a young spring onion;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
strew it over the cress, add a plain dressing,
and serve.</p>

<p><b>Cucumber Salad.</b>&mdash;If properly prepared,
cucumbers are not apt to interfere with
digestion. They should be gathered early
in the morning and kept in a cool place until
wanted. After peeling, slice them <i>very</i>
thin; sprinkle a little salt over them; let
stand ten minutes, and add cayenne, and
equal parts of oil and vinegar. If allowed
to remain in salt water any length of time,
if oil is omitted, or if their natural juices
are squeezed out of them, they become indigestible.</p>

<p><b>Currant Salad.</b>&mdash;Put a pint of red currants
in the centre of a compote. Around
them make a border of a pint of white currants,
and around these arrange a border of
red raspberries. Set the dish on the table.
Take a pint of sweet cream, add to it three
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; stir it
up to dissolve the sugar; while doing so add
a tablespoonful each of brandy and cura&ccedil;oa.
Set the sauce on the table; dish up the
fruit; and let each guest help himself to
the sauce.</p>

<p><b>Dandelion Salad.</b>&mdash;A dandelion salad is
one of the healthiest of spring salads. Take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
two quarts of freshly gathered dandelions;
wash them well; pick them over carefully;
let stand in water over night, as this improves
them. Drain, and dry in a napkin;
place them in a salad-bowl; add two young
spring onions, minced. Serve with a plain
dressing.</p>

<p><b>Dumas Salad</b> (Devised by Alexandre
Dumas).&mdash;"Put in a salad-bowl a yolk of
egg boiled hard; add a tablespoonful of oil,
and make a paste of it; then add a few
stalks of chervil chopped fine, a teaspoonful
each of tunny and anchovy paste, a little
French mustard, a small pickled cucumber
chopped fine, the white of the egg chopped
fine, and a little soy. Mix the whole well
with two tablespoonfuls of wine vinegar;
then add two or three steamed potatoes
sliced, a few slices of beet, same of celeriac,
same of rampion, salt and Hungarian pepper
to taste; toss gently twenty minutes,
then serve."</p>

<p><b>Eels, Mayonnaise of.</b>&mdash;Put into a salad-bowl
two heads of bleached endive, each
leaf having been previously examined. Take
six pieces of potted eels about two inches
long; remove the bone; break the eels into
neat pieces, and arrange them on the endive;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
add a mayonnaise, garnish, and
serve.</p>

<p><b>Egg Salad.</b>&mdash;Put into a salad-bowl the
small crisp leaves of a head of lettuce; add
four hard-boiled eggs sliced. Mince a dozen
capers; sprinkle over the eggs, and add a
plain dressing.</p>

<p><b>Endive Salad.</b>&mdash;The curled endive is excellent
for fall and winter salads. Pick the
leaves over carefully; separate the green
from the white; put the latter into a salad-bowl;
add minced salad herbs, and a suspicion
of onion. Serve with plain dressing.</p>

<p><b>Escarole Salad.</b>&mdash;This is one of the best
salads known. Serve it as follows: Take
two heads of escarole; reject all green and
decayed leaves; place the white bleached
leaves in a salad-bowl, after being thoroughly
washed and dried in a napkin; take a small
piece of crust of bread, and a clove of garlic,
dip the garlic in salt and rub it a
few times on the bread; add the piece of
bread to the salad-bowl. Next add half a
teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper,
and four tablespoonfuls of the very best
olive oil; toss the salad gently; then add
a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar; toss
again; remove the piece of crust, which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
known as "Chapon," and serve. Escarole
is the broad-leaved variety of the well-known
<i>endive</i>.</p>

<p><b>Frog Salad.</b>&mdash;This is a delicious salad.
Soak two dozen frogs' legs in salt water for
one hour; drain; stew them slowly until
quite tender; take them out of the boiling
water and cover them with milk. Let this
come to a boil; drain and cool; remove the
bones. Cut up celery enough to half fill a
salad-bowl; add the frogs which should
nearly fill the bowl. Arrange neatly; cover
with mayonnaise; garnish with lobster-claws,
little tufts of shrimps, and green
herbs, alternated with hard-boiled eggs
quartered lengthwise.</p>

<p><b>Herbs for Salads.</b>&mdash;The most important desideratum
(except possibly pure condiments)
in the art of salad making, is those little
salad herbs that to many appear insignificant,
but to the epicure perfect a salad. All
travellers tell us that French salads are far
superior to the salads of other countries;
but without fragrant herbs the French salads
would be as insipid as those of England. I
strongly advise my readers to cultivate a
taste for these precious little herbs: Tarragon,
borage, chervil, chives, and pimpernel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Herring Salad.</b>&mdash;Soak four salt Holland
herrings in water or milk for three hours;
then remove the skin and back-bone and cut
them into neat square pieces. Slice two
quarts of boiled potatoes; while hot, put them
into a dish and pour over them Rhine wine
enough to moisten them; when cold add the
herring and the yolks of four hard-boiled
eggs, chopped up. Crush a dozen pepper
corns in a napkin, with a knife-handle,
add to the salad and mix all together. If
milt herring are used, pound the milt to a
paste, moisten with vinegar, add to the salad.
If roe herring are used, soak the roe in vinegar
for a few minutes and strew the eggs
over the salad. If the herrings have been
soaked too long a little salt should be added.
The above is a true herring salad, though
some add a little oil, but the majority prefer
it as above directed.</p>

<p><b>Hop Salad.</b>&mdash;Hop-sprouts are not only
wholesome but are a most excellent vegetable.
In hop-growing districts the surplus
sprouts are thrown away. This is an error.
Gather the sprouts before the heads develop,
soak them for half an hour in water
slightly salted; drain; boil for ten minutes,
and serve them with a plain salad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
dressing. They may be eaten either hot or
cold.</p>

<p><b>Italian Salad.</b>&mdash;Nearly all mixed vegetable
salads that contain various ingredients
may be safely called <i>&agrave; l'Italienne</i>, for all culinary
odds and ends are made into salads by
these thrifty people, and it must not for an
instant be supposed that the different items
are thrown indifferently together. On the
contrary, they study the all-important problem
of how to first please the eye, so that
their gastronomic effort may more easily
please the palate. A salad of eight or ten
ingredients is usually arranged on a round
plate, wheel fashion, with half of a hard-boiled
egg, cut crosswise, to represent a
hub. When only five ingredients are used,
the salad takes the forms of stars or other
shapes as fancy dictates. They are usually
served with plain salad dressing.</p>

<p><b>Lamb Salad.</b>&mdash;In hot weather this salad
is very acceptable. Put into a salad-bowl
the crisp small centre leaves of two heads
of cabbage lettuce. Cut up three-fourths
of a pound of cold roast lamb, add to the
lettuce. Chop up a dozen capers with a few
tarragon leaves; strew over the salad; serve
with a plain salad dressing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Lettuce Salad.</b>&mdash;Take two good sized
heads of the broad- or long-leaved varieties
of lettuce; separate the leaves; wipe them
carefully to remove all grit; break or tear
each leaf apart (do not cut lettuce); put
them in a salad-bowl; add oil, pepper, and
salt, and a teaspoonful of chopped herbs;
toss lightly. Now add the vinegar, toss
again, and serve immediately.&mdash;For proportions
see <a href="#Plain_Salad_Dressing">Plain Salad Dressing</a>.</p>

<p><b><a name="Lobster_Salad" id="Lobster_Salad"></a>Lobster Salad.</b>&mdash;Take two live hen or
female lobsters; boil them thirty minutes;
drain. When cold, break them apart; crack
the claws, and if the tail fins are covered
with eggs remove them carefully. Take
out the sand pouch found near the head,
split the fleshy part of the tail in two lengthwise,
remove the small long entrail found
therein. Adhering to the body-shell may
be found a layer of creamy fat, save this,
and also the green fat in the body of the
lobster (called Tom Alley by New Englanders)
and the coral. If celery is used, tear
the lobster into shreds with forks; if lettuce,
cut the lobster into half inch pieces;
place the salad herb in a bowl, add the lobster
and the fat; and pour over it a rich
mayonnaise; garnish with the claws and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
heads, tufts of green, hard-boiled eggs, etc.
The lobster eggs may be separated and
sprinkled over the mayonnaise. The coral
is used for coloring mayonnaise, and also
butter, which is then used in decorating
salmon and other dark fish, used in salads.</p>

<p><b>Melon Salad.</b>&mdash;The best way to eat a
melon is unquestionably with a little salt,
but melons are very deceptive, they may
look delicious, but from growing in the
same field with squashes and other vegetables
they often taste insipid. Such may be
made quite palatable in salads. Cut the
melon into strips; then remove the skin;
cut the eatable part into pieces, and send to
table with a plain dressing.</p>

<p><b>Mint Salad.</b>&mdash;This is an egg salad with
the addition of six leaves of mint chopped
fine, serve with a plain dressing, and with or
after cold roast lamb.</p>

<p><b>Orange Salads.</b>&mdash;Peel and slice three
oranges that have been on ice. Remove the
seeds, arrange the slices in a compote, cover
with powdered sugar, and add two tablespoonfuls
each of maraschino, cura&ccedil;oa, and
brandy. Let it stand an hour in the ice-box
before serving. Or, arrange in a dish a
neat border of cold boiled rice. Peel and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
divide into sections three Florida oranges;
put the oranges in the centre; dust powdered
sugar over all, and set the dish in the
ice-box. Just before serving pour over the
salad two wineglassfuls of arrack. A plain
salad dressing is served with orange salad in
some places in the East, but would not suit
the American palate.</p>

<p><b>Oyster Salad.</b>&mdash;Boil two dozen small oysters
for five minutes in water enough to cover
them; add a little salt and a tablespoonful
of vinegar; drain and cool. Put into a salad-bowl
the centre leaves of two heads of cabbage
lettuce, add the oysters whole, pour
over them a mayonnaise; garnish with oyster-crabs,
hard-boiled eggs, and, if liked, a
few anchovies cut into fillets.</p>

<p><b>Pigeon Salad.</b>&mdash;Wild pigeons are at times
so plentiful that they can be purchased for
75 cents per dozen. They are usually served
broiled, roasted, or in pies; but pigeon salad
is a very dainty dish. Take equal parts of
celery and roasted pigeon; arrange neatly,
with mayonnaise; garnish and serve.</p>

<p><b>Pineapple Salad.</b>&mdash;Peel and dig out the
eyes of two very ripe pineapples. Take
hold of the crown of the pine with the left
hand; take a fork in the right hand and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with it tear the pine into shreds until there
is nothing left but the core, which throw
away. Place the shredded fruit lightly in a
compote. Take half a pint of white sugar
syrup; add to it a wineglassful of arrack, a
tablespoonful of brandy, and one of cura&ccedil;oa.
Mix and pour over the pines. Set in ice-box.
When cold, serve.</p>

<p><b>Potato Salad.</b>&mdash;Cut up into slices two
quarts of boiled potatoes <i>while hot</i>; add to
them a teaspoonful each of chopped onion
and parsley; pour over them a liberal quantity
of plain salad dressing. If the potatoes
should then appear too dry, add a little hot
water, or better still, soup stock; toss lightly
so as not to break the slices; then place
the salad on ice to become cold. Serve by
placing a leaf of lettuce on each small
plate, and add two tablespoonfuls of the potato
to the lettuce, for each person. Cold
boiled potatoes do not make a good potato
salad.</p>

<p><b>Prawn Salad.</b>&mdash;These dainties can always
be obtained in Fulton Market, cooked
and shelled. Take one quart of prawns and
one quart and a pint of cut celery; put the
celery in a bowl; add the prawns; garnish
neatly and serve with a mayonnaise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Rabbit Salad.</b>&mdash;Rabbits are always cheap
and good, from November to January, and
should be enjoyed by the poor as well as
the rich. Cut up the flesh of two roasted
rabbits into neat pieces; place them in a
bowl and cover with a plain dressing; add
a teaspoonful of minced salad herbs; let
stand for four hours. Put into a salad-bowl
the leaves of three hearts of cabbage lettuce;
drain the meat, and add to the lettuce.
Put into a soup plate a teaspoonful of
French mustard; thin it with a tablespoonful
of the dressing drained from the meat,
and gradually add to this a pint of mayonnaise,
then pour it over the salad.</p>

<p><b>Salmon Salads.</b>&mdash;Broil two salmon
steaks; when done break the fish into flakes
and add to it a little salt, pepper, and two
tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Let stand
for an hour. Half fill a salad-bowl with lettuce;
add the fish, and garnish with hard-boiled
eggs, stoned olives, and a few spiced
oysters.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Put into a salad-bowl three stalks
of celery, sliced; add half a pound of canned
salmon; arrange neatly; add mayonnaise;
garnish and serve.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Boil a six-pound salmon, whole;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
when done and cold place it on a long fish-platter;
prepare a red mayonnaise (see
<a href="#Lobster_Salad">Lobster Salad</a>); fill a paper cornucopia with
the sauce and squeeze it through the small
end over the fish in waves, to represent
scales. Garnish with the small centre hearts
of lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cray-fish, and
little mounds of shrimps or oyster crabs.</p>

<p><b>Sardine Salad.</b>&mdash;Wash the oil from six
sardines, remove skin and bone and pour a
little lemon juice over them. Put into a
salad-bowl the leaves of a head of crisp lettuce;
add the fish. Chop up two hard-boiled
eggs, add to the fish, and serve with
a plain dressing. Some do not approve of
the washing process, but one of the principal
reasons why Americans dislike oil is the
fact that they first tasted it on sardines with
which a poor fish-oil is generally used, and
the reason that the trade in sardines has fallen
off, is owing to the poor oil used in the
canning of these otherwise dainty fish.</p>

<p><b>Scollop Salad.</b>&mdash;Soak twenty-five scollops
in salt water for half an hour; rinse
them in cold water and boil twenty minutes;
drain. Cut them into thin slices; mix with
an equal quantity of sliced celery; cover
with mayonnaise, garnish, and serve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Tomato Salad.</b>&mdash;A perfect tomato salad
is prepared as follows: Take three fine
ripe August tomatoes and scald them a moment;
skin, and set on ice to cool; slice;
put them into a salad-bowl; add a teaspoonful
of chopped tarragon and a plain salad
dressing. Sliced tomatoes with mayonnaise
are not to be despised.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p class="center"><b>E. C.'s Salad Dressing.</b></p>

<p>Pour one pint of boiling water into a farina
boiler; add six tablespoonfuls of vinegar;
place on the stove. Beat six eggs
lightly. Mix, with a little cold water, two
tablespoonfuls of mustard, two teaspoonfuls
of salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and
one heaping tablespoonful of corn-starch.</p>

<p>Beat this mixture up with the eggs, and
stir it very slowly into the boiling water and
vinegar, after having removed the latter
from the stove&mdash;in order to prevent possibility
of curdling. Return to the stove;
stir constantly until quite thick. Remove
from the stove, and add immediately half a
pound of butter; stir until the butter is thoroughly
melted. Now put the yolks of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
eggs on a plate, and, using a fork, mix gradually
with them half a pint of olive-oil, stirring
it in vigorously. When the first mixture
is cold, beat the second into it. If
more oil is desired, the yolk of another egg
must be mixed with it.</p>

<p>This recipe will make about one quart of
dressing. If less is wished, part of the first
mixture can be saved in a cool place, and
can be used later by making a fresh supply
of the olive-oil mixed with yolk of egg.</p>

<p><b>S. F.'s Shrimp Salad.</b>&mdash;Boil a quart of
fresh shrimps for twenty minutes. Open
and throw away the shells. Take the crisp
leaves of a head of lettuce, and place in a
salad-bowl with two fresh tomatoes peeled
and sliced. Add the shrimps and pour over
all a mayonnaise&mdash;red, if convenient&mdash;and
serve.</p>
